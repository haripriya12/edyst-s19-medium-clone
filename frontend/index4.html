                        &#169; It’s hard to reconcile data and technology in healthcare, where 
                        nothing is more personal and nuanced than one’s health. Yet, over
                        the past three to four years, we’ve seen the healthcare industry 
                        apply technology to unpack the value drivers of health personalization
                        by organizing and actioning customer and clinical data. The reasoning 
                        is simple – technology allows us to take data from a human scale to a 
                        digital scale.

                        To deliver meaningful care, you have to know your patient – who 
                        they are, where they are, and what they’re looking for. You have 
                        to be able to deliver relevant experiences to them that drive real
                         benefit because what works for one woman doesn’t necessarily work 
                         for another. You need data to do this. There’s an undeniable need 
                         for education like the articles and resources found in many femtech 
                         apps and gadgets geared at enhancing a women’s wellbeing, mostly 
                         focusing on fertility, reproductive health, or menstrual health. But
                          there’s a disconnect between the information a user is asked to input 
                          and the tools and information returned, like calendar alerts.
